# Think of the lines within the --- as switches. Some can be set to true or false like a light switch
# Some take a specific type of data like a number, a date, or text.
# Some are commented (they have  a # in front of them like this line). Remove the # to make them do something.
# Commented lines will be ignored and the fields will default to some value defined in code.

# this content will be auto-applied to the layout. Prefer this over putting info in the markdown!
title: 'Touchdesigner Thursdays'              # The largest visible Text in the Footer
description: 'Bring your own laptop & beer'   # The (small) line under the title
type: 'Workshops'                             # the larger text in the bottom left.

timeAndDate: '14.06 | 18:00'                  # the time and date of the event, will be displayed top right over the background. Choose any formatting. I recommend dd.mm | hh.mm

# put any additional content you want to put in the frame below.
# This will be autoformatted over the background.
# Separate text blocks will generate distinct text containers, headings (prefix the line with `# ` for H1, `## ` for H2 and so on, mind the space after #) will be rendered as large text.
# No other markdown features are implemented and tested as of now. General styling (bold, italic, etc.) might work.
